# Discord Assist

Talk to Home Assistant's Assist from Discord.

A Home Assistant custom integration that exposes the Assist conversation agent over a Discord bot. Users can send messages in configured channels or DMs, and the bot replies using whichever conversation agent you select (e.g. a local LLM, OpenAI, or the built-in Home Assistant Assist agent).

## Features

- Responds in configured guild text channels
- Responds to direct messages (optional)
- Responds to @mentions in any channel the bot can see (optional)
- Per-conversation context window with configurable idle timeout
- Replies in threads under the channels it listens to
- Maps Discord user IDs to Home Assistant users so commands run as the right person
- Fails closed: Discord users it cannot run as a Home Assistant user are ignored
- Replies can never ping `@everyone`, roles, or users
- Retries setup when Discord is unreachable and reloads if the gateway dies
- `Discord gateway` connectivity sensor for alerting
- Repair issues for "nobody is authorized" and a missing Message Content intent
- One-click import from the Discord Conversation integration it was forked from

## Security model

**The conversation agent can control your home.** Discord Assist only answers a Discord user when it knows which Home Assistant user to run the request as:

- A Discord user with a **user mapping** acts as the mapped Home Assistant user.
- A Discord user on the **allowlist** without a mapping acts as the **fallback Home Assistant user**. With no fallback user set, allowlisted users are ignored.
- Everyone else is ignored, even in channels the bot listens to.

Requests never run without a Home Assistant user, so permissions always apply. Use a dedicated, least-privilege account as the fallback user, and limit `channels` to places you trust. If nobody is authorized, a repair issue appears under **Settings → System → Repairs**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2026.6.0 or later
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) installed

### Install via HACS

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
3. Add `https://github.com/catduckgnaf/ha-discord-assist` with category **Integration**.
4. Find **Discord Assist** in the HACS integration list and install it.
5. Restart Home Assistant.

## Discord setup

### Create a Discord application and bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **New Application**.
2. Name the application (e.g. "Home Assistant") and click **Create**.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Bot**.
4. Click **Add Bot** → **Yes, do it!**
5. Under **Token**, click **Reset Token** and copy the token — you will need it during integration setup.
6. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable **Message Content Intent**. Without this, the bot cannot read message text in guild channels.

### Invite the bot to your server

1. In the Developer Portal, go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**.
2. Under **Scopes**, select `bot` and `applications.commands`.
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, select **Read Messages/View Channels**, **Send Messages**, and **Read Message History**.
4. Copy the generated URL, open it in your browser, and invite the bot to your server.

## Migrating from Discord Conversation

If the Discord Conversation integration is already set up, adding Discord Assist offers **Import from Discord Conversation**. That copies the bot token and every setting, then disables (does not delete) the old entry so the bot is not driven twice. Once you are happy, remove Discord Conversation from HACS. Unmapped, non-allowlisted users who could use the old integration are ignored here.

## Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **Discord Assist**.
2. Enter the bot token.
3. Select a conversation agent (e.g. `conversation.home_assistant`).
4. Select the channels the bot should read. Only text channels the bot can see are listed.
5. Adjust the remaining options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Channels to listen in | (none) | Guild text channels where the bot responds to all messages |
| Respond to direct messages | Yes | Whether to respond when users DM the bot |
| Respond to @mentions anywhere | Yes | Whether to respond when the bot is @mentioned in any channel |
| Idle minutes | 30 | Minutes of inactivity before conversation context resets |
| Language | (HA default) | BCP-47 language tag passed to the conversation agent |
| Allowed Discord user IDs | (none) | Discord user IDs allowed to use the bot as the fallback user; mapped users are always allowed |

## User mapping

Map a Discord user ID to a specific Home Assistant user so commands run with that user's permissions.

### Find a Discord user ID

1. In Discord, open **User Settings → Advanced** and enable **Developer Mode**.
2. Right-click any user and click **Copy User ID**.

### Add a mapping

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services**, find the Discord Assist entry, and click **Configure**.
2. Choose **Add a Discord-to-Home-Assistant user mapping**.
3. Enter the Discord user ID and select the Home Assistant user.

### Fallback user

Set **Fallback Home Assistant user** in options to control which HA user is used for Discord users who have no explicit mapping. Use a dedicated, least-privilege account for this.
